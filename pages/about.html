        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p class="aboutme-text">Born and raised in San Francisco, California, I've always carried both African and Japanese cultures in my being. Both worlds have taught me the value of perspective and adaptability. After graduating from university, I felt a deep urge to explore my Japanese roots, which led me to moving across the world and starting a new life in Japan. </p>
        
         <p class="aboutme-text">Over the past ten years, I've had the privilege of working as an Event Coordinator for a travel agency and as an Academic Tutor at a university. These experiences taught me how to communicate clearly, solve problems creatively, and connect with people from all walks of life.</p>

        <p class="aboutme-text">Despite finding fulfillment in my career, I reached a point where I wanted to push myself even further. The desire to create, to build, to learn something new was brewing within. That's when I discovered Web Development. What began as curiosity quickly turned into passion. I decided to fully commit and enroll in Le Wagon Tokyo's 2-month intensive Web Development Bootcamp, where I learned to bring ideas to life through code and design.</p>

        <p class="aboutme-text">Since completing the program, I've been building my career as a Front-End Developer in Tokyo â€” blending my global background, storytelling mindset, and eye for design to create digital experiences that are both meaningful and visually engaging.</p>
